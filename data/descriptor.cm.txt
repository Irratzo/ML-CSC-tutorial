Coulomb matrixes:

The molecule is represented by a matrix of Coulomb energies [ Z_i Z_j / r_ij ].
On the diagonal we use Z_i^2.4, just because it seems to work ok.
The matrix is then diagonalised and we take its eigenvalues as descriptors.
If a molecule has less than 29 atoms, the descriptor is padded with zeros.
