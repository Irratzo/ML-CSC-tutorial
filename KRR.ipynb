    "KRR is a one of the ML methods to perform regression (fitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we use kernel function $d$ that measures the distance between two data points.\n",
    "With the function we build the kernel matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "K_{ij} =  d(M_{i}, M_{j}) - \\alpha I_{ij}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "for all pairs of samples $M_i$ and $M_j$ in the training set. $I_{ij}$ is the identity matrix and $\\alpha$ is a hyperparameter chosen between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to predict the output of a new sample or set of samples that were not in the training set, we need to first evaluate the distance between them and the training samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "D_{ij} =  d(T_{i}, M_{j})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_i$ is one of the new samples. The output prediction $\\mathbf{y_T}$ for the test set $T$ is obtained by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{y_T} = \\mathbf{y_M} \\cdot K^{-1} \\cdot D^T\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "where $\\mathbf{y_M}$ is the vector of known outputs for the training set $M$."
